if you try case 1:
connected your main Arduino uno R3 with computer to generate the necessary ppm signals.
further you only need to connect 3 pins from your arduino uno R3 to the transceiver module.

if you try case 2:
Here it becomes complex as you need to connect your arduino mini with nRF24L01 module
connect both the things as per the below mentioned table.

new step: binding

Once the devices are connected as per the last step, the only thing that remains is binding.
case 1:
Here its simple as the module that we have already has the latest code inside and hence you
only need to run the ppm generation code to the Arduino. Now turn on the RC quadcopter by connecting
battery wires and you will see the blinking LEDs. 
In 3-4 seconds you will observe the steadily turned on LEDs. Now all you need to do is execute the final step.

case 2:
In this case, you actually need to dive a bit deep inside the case. Here you need to replace the
